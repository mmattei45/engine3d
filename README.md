# Java Terminal 3d Engine

![smaller-teapot](https://github.com/mmattei45/engine3d/assets/36969485/c9fa8818-7be0-4806-88c3-19bcd3903e0a)

This is a very simple 3d engine that uses the terminal as a screen. Keep in mind that this is just for fun project.

## How to run
Because of the ncurses dependency, it is currently only possible to run this project on linux.

```Ã¬nstall ncurses lib```

select a .obj file on "Main.java".

```./run.sh```

## TODO List
- Clean the code
- Get rid of the hard coded screen size
- Improve the Terminal interface and implement a Swing Terminal so Windows users can run the project
- Solve the 3d text issue
- Create a menu for the program, and remove .obj files from the source code
